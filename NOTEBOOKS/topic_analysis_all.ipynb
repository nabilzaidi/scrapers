      "when i later went into the person s profile  it turned out that it was not the first time this person behaved like that when there were people with more privacy than i  or poorer knowledge of how trader works  as reported similar stories  here i had as a seller to be able to refuse people with cash ratings as buyers from buda  or at least happy to have been trading been more generous with the shutdowns in order to sum up this point  the system is thus purely gaming theoretically built up in a way where people pull away from giving a review before someone else given a review and where no dare to give a negative judgment in fear of getting an equally bad back as someone kind of revenge  here you can advantageously look at how other platforms such as airbnb work  there both people have a certain time to leave a review  and the reviews do not be public until this period is over  why do not use a system similar to this is for me incomprehensible \n",
